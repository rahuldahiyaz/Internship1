# Even/Odd Number Checker

I built this tiny Java console program to do one simple thing:  
ask for a number, then tell you if it’s even or odd.

## Why I Made It
When learning Java, I wanted to practice the basics — taking input from a user, using `if` statements, and working with the modulus operator (`%`).  
It’s a very small project, but it covers a lot of the first things you learn as a Java beginner.

## How It Works
The program:
1. Asks the user to type in an integer.
2. Uses `number % 2` to figure out if there’s a remainder when dividing by 2.
   - No remainder? It’s even.
   - Remainder? It’s odd.
3. Prints the result.

That’s it. Simple and quick.
