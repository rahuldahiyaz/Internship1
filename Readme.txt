# Even / Odd Checker (Java)

This is a small Java console app I wrote to check whether a number is even or odd.  
It’s one of those classic beginner programs, but it’s actually a great way to learn the basics.

## The Idea
I wanted to practice:
- Taking user input in Java
- Using the modulus operator `%`
- Writing simple `if` / `else` logic

So I built this quick program where you type a number and it instantly tells you if it’s even or odd.

## How It Works
1. The program asks you to enter an integer.
2. It checks the remainder when dividing that number by 2 (`number % 2`).
3. If the remainder is 0 → it’s **even**.  
   Otherwise → it’s **odd**.
4. The result is printed to the screen.
